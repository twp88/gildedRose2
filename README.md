# Gilded Rose Kata; Take 2

This is the second time that I've done this kata, the first time being nearly two
years ago.
My goal was to test myself, having forgotten what my original solution was, and use
nothing but my knowledge of ruby and coding principles. This was to be done within
a limited time period. I would then compare my solution to that of Sandi Metz as
demonstrated at [Rails Conf 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE).
This would then provide content for my text blog post, being able to compare,
analyse and debate the two solutions.

In short, my solution resembles Sandi Metz's in that both use inheritance to
create a pattern. However, Metz takes hers further in ways which I would argue
potentially contravene the original rules.

## Things I would improve

In terms of the code, I would like to have refactored the tests in order to reduce
repetition.
